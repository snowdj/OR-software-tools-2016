# Networks in R
This course covers the excellent `igraph` package that allows to create, analyse and visualize networks in R. We will use these tools to analyse the taxi rides in New York city and to study Manhattan's routing network.

## Pre-assignment
### Git update
Please update your git repository to get the latest version of everything. To do so, go to your repository and:

```
  git pull
```

## Packages
We will use the new packages `igraph` and `RColorBrewer`. Please install them using the following commands:

```
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
```

## Assignment
First, start R and set your working directory to the 4-graphs folder of the git repository. Then, run the following commands

```
library(igraph)
set.seed(144)
max(betweenness(erdos.renyi.game(100, 0.5)))
```

Please submit the output of this R input (one line) in a .txt file on Stellar.
