# Session 2: Data Wrangling in R. 

Welcome to the second session of 15.S60! In this session, we'll discuss tools for data exploration, cleaning, and manipulation using state-of-the-art packages for the `R` programming language. 

## Preassignment: Installing Software

Before Thursday's session, please fire up RStudio and run the following commands in the console window: 

    install.packages('dplyr')
    install.packages('tidyr')
    
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)

    data.frame(a = c("Col1","Col2"), b= c(5,10)) %>% spread(a,b)

The result should look like this: 

      Col1 Col2
    1    5   NA
    2   NA   10

To confirm, please post a snapshot of your RStudio console with the code and output to Stellar before Thursday morning. 

## Files in this Directory

### Keeping Current

To ensure that you have the most current versions of all files, please fire up a terminal, navigate to the directory into which you cloned the full set of materials for 15.S60, and run `git pull`. 

### Main Files
You'll see a number of files in this directory. The ones you'll need for Thursday are:

- `script.r`: This is the script we'll be following as we code through examples together. We recommend that you open up your local version of this file and follow along. You can run the commands shown in class directly from this script.
- `exercises.R`: After each main presentation section, you'll break off and work on your own or with a neighbor to work through a few more examples. This file contains both the prompts and solutions. 

You may also find the following files useful:
- `presentation.R`: This is a skeleton script that contains comments following the outline of `script.r`, but doesn't contain any of the commands. If you feel you'd like somewhere to type out the code yourself during the session, you can use this skeleton file instead of or in addition to `script.R`.
- `grades.R`: A short script that contains the commands shown on the toy data set in the slides. This file is primarily for your reference.

## Additional Resources

`dplyr` and `tidyr` are well-established packages within the `R` community, and there are many resources to use for reference and further learning. Some of our favorites are below.
